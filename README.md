# AI-Powered Journaling CLI

This repository contains my solution for the Palo Alto Networks Intern Engineer Case Study.

I chose **Option 1: AI-Powered Journaling Logic**. The goal is to build a small command-line tool
that ingests free-form journal text and tags each entry with mental well-being signals
(e.g., mood, energy, stress) while handling ambiguous language like "crushing it" vs "crushing me".

More details, methodology, and AI usage notes will be added as the implementation evolves.
